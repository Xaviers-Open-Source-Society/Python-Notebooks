    "Python is considered as an object oreinted scripting language.It is optimized for programmer productivity, code readability, and software quality. It has vast scope as it is fast and flexible mode of development. It is simple and less code intensive as compared to traditional programming languages. \n",
    "<h2>Why do we use Python?</h2> \n",
    "We use Python for the following:\n",
    "<br> •Software Quality:\n",
    "Python has a uniform and readable syntax. It makes the language easier to learn, practise and remember. There is less need for constant reference to manuals.This allows it to be accessed across platforms and one persons code can be easily underestood by another. It focuses on object-oriented and function programming.\n",
    " <br> •Developer productivity:\n",
    " It has increased productivity as the codes are one-third of compiled languages like C,C++. This gives less to type and debug and it does not have the compiling step which increases programmming speed.\n",
    " <br> •Program portibility:\n",
    " Python programs run the same almost on all operating systems. A python program would run the same on Windows as well as Linux and would just a matter of copying codes between machines. Python offers various coding options for GUIs, database access programs, web based systems, etc.\n",
    " <br> •Support libraries:\n",
    " Python comes with a large number of prebuilt functions known as the 'standard library'. Python supports third-party application softwares as well such as website construction,numeric programming, game development. \n",
    " <br> •Component intergration:\n",
    " Python scripts can communicate with other part of an appilication using component integration. It allows Python to be used as a product customization and extension tool. Python can access C and C+= libraries, can be called from C and C++ programs and can integrate with Java and .NET components, can communicate over frameworks such as COM and Silverlight, can interface with devices over serial ports, and can interact over networks with interfaces like SOAP, XML-RPC, and CORBA. It can work as a seperate process as well as an add-on to an existing process.\n",
    " <br> •Enjoyment:\n",
    " Python is efficient, not only because of its built-in toolset but also because of it's ease of use.It makes coding more enjoyable. \n",
    " <br><h2>Is python a scripting language?</h2>\n",
    "Python is a procedural,functional and object-oriented programming language still to describe Python we use the word 'script' instead of 'program'. The term script has three different types of associations made to it by different types of people.\n",
    "<br>-Shell tools:\n",
    "People think of Python as a scripting language because it is used for coding operating-system-oriented scripts. The programs are launched from console command lines and perform tasks such as processing text files and launching other programs.\n",
    "<br>-Control language:\n",
    "Python is used to direct other application components. During hardware testing, Python programs call the components that give low-level access to a device. It runs bits of code at stratigic points and does not compile the entire source code at the end. Most Python programmers code using python as a standalone tool without using integrated components.\n",
    "<br>-Ease of use:\n",
    "It is a simple programming language used for quickly coding. Even though it is easy it is a sophisticated coding language and can be scaled up as needed.\n",
    "<br> In general, scripting language suits Python best when describing the rapid and flexible nature of development of Python rather than a particular application domain.\n",
    "<h2>Downside of Python</h2>\n",
    "The only observed downside to Python is that it's execution speed is not as fast as fully-compiled and lower level languages like C and C++. For some tasks such low level languages as they are more directly mapped to the underlying architecture.Python has been optimized numerous times, and Python code runs fast enough by itself in most application domains. This depends if the speed of execution of the code matters. Furthermore, whenever you do something “real” in a Python script, like processing a file or constructing a graphical user interface (GUI), your program will actually run at C speed, since such tasks are immediately dispatched to compiled C code inside the Python interpreter. \n",
    "<h2> Who uses Python?</h2>\n",
    "Python has roughly 1 million users around. some of the general Python users are listed below:\n",
    "<br>• Google makes extensive use of Python in its web search systems.\n",
    "<br>• The popular YouTube video sharing service is largely written in Python.\n",
    "<br>• The Dropbox storage service codes both its server and desktop client software primarily in Python. \n",
    "<br>• The Raspberry Pi single-board computer promotes Python as its educational language\n",
    "<br>• Google’s App Engine web development framework uses Python as an application language. \n",
    "<br>• Netflix and Yelp have both documented the role of Python in their software infrastructures\n",
    "<h2> Uses of Python</h2>\n",
    "Python is used to accomplish a number of real world tasks. It can perform website development,gaming,robotics,spacecraft,etc. Common Python roles are classified into broader catagories:-\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "SYSTEM PROGRAMMING:<br>\n",
    "Python's built-in interfaces to operating-system services make it ideal for writing portable, maintainable system-administration tools and utilities known as shell tools. Python programs can search files and directory trees,launch others programs,do parallel processing with processes and threads.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "GUIs:<br>\n",
    "Due to its simplicity and speed it is useful for graphical user interface programming on desktop. Python comes with a standard object-oriented interface to the Tk GUI API called tkinter (Tkinter in 2.X) that allows Python programs to implement portable GUIs with a native look and feel.  Python/tkinter GUIs run unchanged on Microsoft Windows, X Windows (on Unix and Linux), and the Mac OS (both Classic and OS X).\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "INTERNET SCRIPTING:\n",
    "<br>Python can be used in client and server mode for performing networking tasks with the help of standard Internet modules.In addition, a large collection of third-party tools are available on the Web for doing Internet programming in Python. For instance, the HTMLGen system generates HTML files from Python class-based descriptions, the mod_python package runs Python efficiently within the Apache web server and supports server-side templating with its Python Server Pages, and the Jython system provides for seamless Python/Java integration and supports coding of server-side applets that run on clients. Full-blown wen development framework packages for Python support full-featured and production quality websites can be created using python.Python has expanded into Rich Internet applications with tools such as Silverlight in IronPython anad pyjs and its Python-to-JavaScript compiler,AJAX framework and widget set.Python has also moved into cloud computing.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "COMPONENT INTEGRATION:\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "It is Pyton's ability to be integrated and extended by other languages like C and C++ making it flexible glue language for scripting the behaviour of other components and systems.For instance, integrating a C library into Python enables Python to test and launch the library’s components, and embedding Python in a product enables onsite customizations to be coded without having to recompile the entire product.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "DATABSE PROGRAMMING:\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "For the purpose of database demands Python has interfaces to all commonly used database systems like Oracle,Informix,MySQL and more.\n",
    " Python’s standard pickle module provides a simple object persistence system—it allows programs to easily save and restore entire Python objects to files and file-like objects. Even then other systems provide more specialized ways of data storing,including Google's App engine, which models data with Python classes which provides extensive scalability as well as additional emerging cloud storage options.\n",
    " <br>\n",
    "RAPID PROTOTYPING:\n",
    " <br>\n",
    " The components written in Python and C look the same initially. So it is possible to prototype systems in Python first and then move the selected components into C for compiling. The remaining code that isn't required can continue to remain in C for efficiency of maintenance.\n",
    " <br>\n",
    "NUMERIC AND SCIENTIFIC PROGRAMMING:\n",
    " <br>\n",
    " Python is widely used for numeric programming which is considered to be out of the scope of traditional scripting languages. Prominent here, the NumPy high-performance numeric programming extension for Python mentioned earlier includes such advanced tools as an array object, interfaces to standard mathematical libraries, and much more. By integrating Python with numeric routines coded in a compiled language for speed, NumPy turns Python into a sophisticated yet easy-to-use numeric programming tool that can often replace existing code written in traditional compiled languages such as FORTRAN or C++. Additional numeric tools for Python support animation,3D visualization, parallel processing.\n",
    " <br>\n",
    "Python is also used for the following:<br>\n",
    " \n",
    "• Game programming and multimedia with pygame, cgkit, pyglet, PySoy, Panda3D, and others\n",
    "<br> • Serial port communication on Windows, Linux, and more with the PySerial extension\n",

    "<br>• Document processing and generation with ReportLab, Sphinx, Cheetah, PyPDF, and so on \n",
    "<br>• Data visualization with Mayavi, matplotlib, VTK, VPython, and more\n",
    "<br>• XML parsing with the xml library package, the xmlrpclib module, and third-party extensions \n",
    "<br>• JSON and CSV file processing with the json and csv modules\n",
    "<h2>How is Python Developed and Supported?</h2>\n",
    "Python has a large and active development community that responds to issues and develops enhancements with efficient speed. Python developers work online with a source-control system. Changes are developed per a formal protocol, which includes writing a PEP (Python Enhancement Proposal) or other document, and extensions to Python’s regression testing system.\n",
    "<h2>Open Source Tradeoffs</h2>\n",
    "Having said that, it’s important to note that while Python enjoys a vigorous development community, this comes with inherent tradeoffs. Open source software can also appear chaotic and even resemble anarchy at times, and may not always be as smoothly implemented as the prior paragraphs might imply. Open Source exchange works according to the personal preference of the current set of developers which may or may not be the same as the user.\n",
    "<h2>Strengths of Python</h2>\n",
    "It's Object-Oriented and Functional:<br>\n",
    "Python is entirely an object oriented language. It's classes support polymorphism,operator overloading and multiple inheritance.Besides serving as a powerful code structuring and reuse device, Python’s OOP nature makes it ideal as a scripting tool for other object-oriented systems languages. For example, with the appropriate glue code, Python programs can subclass (specialize) classes implemented in C++, Java, and C#. Python can use both procedural as well as Object-Oriented programming modes. In recent times Python can also perform functional programming.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "It is Free:<br>\n",
    "Python is available for free use and distribution on the Internet. There are no restrictions on copying it, embedding it in your systems, or shipping it with your products. In fact, you can even sell Python’s source code, if you are so inclined. Python software is supported as well. Python online community responds to queries as fast as any commercial software company would. Moreover, because Python comes with complete source code, it empowers developers, leading to the creation of a large team of implementation experts. \n",
    "<br>\n",
    "It is Portable: <br>\n",
    "The standard implementation of Python is written in portable ANSI C, and it compiles and runs on virtually every major platform currently in use. For example, Python programs run today on everything from PDAs to supercomputers. As a partial list, Python is available on: \n",
    "<br>• Linux and Unix systems\n",
    "<br>• Microsoft Windows (all modern flavors) \n",
    "<br>• Mac OS (both OS X and Classic) \n",
    "<br>• BeOS, OS/2, VMS, and QNX \n",
    "<br>• Real-time systems such as VxWorks\n",
    "<br>• Cray supercomputers and IBM mainframes\n",
    "<br>• PDAs running Palm OS, PocketPC, and Linux \n",
    "<br>• Cell phones running Symbian OS, and Windows Mobile\n",
    "<br>• Gaming consoles and iPods\n",
    "<br>• Tablets and smartphones running Google’s Android and Apple’s iOS \n",
    "<br>Like the language interpreter itself, the standard library modules that ship with Python are implemented to be as portable across platform boundaries as possible. Further, Python programs are automatically compiled to portable byte code, which runs the same on any platform with a compatible version of Python installed.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    " It is Powerful: <br>\n",
    " Its toolset places it between traditional scripting languages (such as Tcl, Scheme, and Perl) and systems development languages (such as C, C++, and Java). Python provides all the simplicity and ease of use of a scripting language, along with more advanced software-engineering tools typically found in compiled languages.\n",
    " <br>\n",
    " It is mixable:<br>\n",
    " Python allows components of another programming language to access its contents and accesses the compnents of other programming languages. For example, Python's C API lets C call and be called by Python Programs. Python can be used inside environments of other systems. this also makes Python good at rapid prototyping—systems may be implemented in Python first, to leverage its speed of development, and later moved to C for delivery, one piece at a time, according to performance demands.\n",
    " <br>\n",
    "It is Relatively Easy to Use: <br>\n",
    "It is much simpler as compared to other programming languages like C++, Jave and C#. You only need to type and run it without the intermediate compiling steps which are used in languages like C and C++. . It also provides a deliberately simple syntax and powerful built-in tools.  Python programs are simpler, smaller, and more flexible than equivalent programs in other popular languages.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "It is Relatively Easy to Learn:<br>\n",
    "Python is an easy language to learn for both beginners as well as experienced programmers. It has a much gentler learning curve as compared to most other languages.\n"
