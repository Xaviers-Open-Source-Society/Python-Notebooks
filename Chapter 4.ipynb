    "<h2> INTRODUCTION TO PYTHON OBJECTS</h2>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Python performs certain kinds of operations like addition, subtraction and concatenation on objects.Data takes the form of objects,either built-in objects that Python provides, or objects we create using Python classes or external language tools such as C extension libraries. Everything in Python is an object. Even simple numbers qualify, with values (e.g., 99), and supported operations (addition, subtraction, and so on). \n",
    "<br>\n",
    "PYTHON CONCEPTUAL HIERARCHY:\n",
    "<br>\n",
    " •Programs are composed of modules\n",
    " <br>•Modules contain statements\n",
    " <br>•Statements contain expressions\n",
    " <br>•Expressions create and process objects\n",
    " <br>\n",
    " <h2> Why Use Built-in Types? </h2>\n",
    " Objects also known as data structures are used to represent most components in the application's domain. Laying out memory structures , managung memory allocation, implementing search and access routines are tedious and error prone tasks and distractfrom the actual goal of the program. This is where python helps. unless you special type of processing that built-in objects do not have it is always recommended to use built-in objects instead of implementing your own.\n",
    " <br>\n",
    " •BUILT-IN OBJECTS MAKE IT EASIER TO WRITE:\n",
    " <br>\n",
    " It is an easy way of representing the structure of a problem domain using tools such as collections(lists) and search tables(dictionaries). These can be accessed for free thus getting a lotof work done out of Python's built-in objects. \n",
    " <br>\n",
    " •BUILT-IN OBJECTS ARE COMPONENTS OF EXTENSIONS:\n",
    " <br>\n",
    " For complex tasks, one can use Python classes or C language interfaces. Objects implemented manually are often built on top of built-in types such as lists and dictionaries. For instance, a stack data structure may be implemented as a class that manages or customizes a built-in list. \n",
    " <br>\n",
    " •BUILT-IN OBJECTS ARE OFTEN MORE EFFICIENT THAN CUSTOM DATA STRUCTURES:\n",
    " <br>\n",
    " Objetcs in C are implemented for their speed. Python uses already existing data structures from C and use them for a high level of performance.\n",
    " <br>\n",
    " •BUILT-IN OBJECTS ARE A STANDARD PART OF THE LANGUAGE:\n",
    " <br>\n",
    "  Python borrows both from languages that rely on built-in tools (e.g., LISP) and languages that rely on the programmer to provide tool implementations or frameworks of their own (e.g., C++). Pythons built-in objects are standard and do not differ along different platforms.\n",
    "  <br>\n",
    " <h2>Python's core datatypes</h2>\n",
    " •NUMBERS:\n",
    " <br>\n",
    "  Python’s core objects set includes the usual suspects: integers that have no fractional part, floating-point numbers that do, and more exotic types—complex numbers with imaginary parts, decimals with fixed precision, rationals with numerator and denominator, and full-featured sets. Built-in numbers have a big limit but third-party add-ons can always be used.<br>\n",
    "Normal mathematical operators are used to perform operations like '+'for addition, '*' for multiplication and so on.\n",
    "Python provides more precision on larger numbers.  You can, for instance, compute 2 to the power 1,000,000 as an integer. One should not try for more than 300000 digits as it might take a while."

    "UNICODE STRINGS:\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Python’s strings also come with full Unicode support required for processing text in internationalized character sets. Characters in the Japanese and Russian alphabets, for example, are outside the ASCII set. Such non-ASCII text can show up in web pages, emails, GUIs, JSON, XML, or elsewhere. When it does, handling it well requires Unicode support. Python has such support built in, but the form of its Unicode support varies per Python line, and is one of their most prominent differences. Non-Unicode strings are sequences of 8-bit bytes that print with ASCII characters when possible, and Unicode strings are sequences of Unicode code points—identifying numbers for characters, which do not necessarily map to single bytes when encoded to files or stored in memory. In fact, the notion of bytes doesn’t apply to Unicode: some encodings include character code points too large for a byte, and even simple 7-bit ASCII text is not stored one byte per character under some encodings and memory storage schemes."
